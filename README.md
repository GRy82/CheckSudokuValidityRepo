# CheckSudokuValidityRepo
Earlier today, I solved a leetcode problem where you need to validate a sudoku puzzle. I did this in one method, which can be seen commented out, but decided I needed to redo the problem in a more sophisticated manner.  Next, I will attempt to use memoization to prevent the checking of 3x3 grids in the sudoku that have already been checked and deemed valid.
